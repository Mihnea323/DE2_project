## Theoretical Description of the Project
  Our project consists of a GPS tracker that integrates an ESP-WROOM-32 board with a GPS module, I2C temperature and humidity sensor, and an OLED display to monitor location and environmental data in real time. The GPS module provides latitude, longitude, and altitude via UART, while the sensor measures temperature and humidity over I2C. The ESP32 processes this data and displays it on the OLED screen.

## Hardware Description
  Our hardware setup includes:
  - Microcontroller (ESP-32): acts as the central processing unit, interfacing with the GPS module, temperature and humidity sensor, and the OLED display.
  - GPS module (NEO-6M-0-001): receives signals from GPS satellites to compute geographical location, it provides the longitude, latitude and altitude.
  - I2C temperature/humidity sensor (DHT12): measures ambient temperature and humidity and transmits the data digitally via the I2C bus.
  - OLED display (SH1106 I2C): displays the GPS data and the environmental data.
